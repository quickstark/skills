Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save to the temporary directory of the user's OS - not the current workspace.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the document, which suggests skills that the agent should invoke.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.

## Completion report and next steps

Finish with a concise, readable completion report. Plain text or restrained Markdown is sufficient; do not create a separate report or HTML file unless this skill's primary workflow requires one.

```text
Status: Completed | Awaiting input | Blocked
Skills used: /qs-flow-handoff; /another-skill only if actually used
Outcome: What was completed, discovered, decided, or is blocking progress.
Outputs: Real files, reports, decisions, or changes, when applicable.
Checks: Only the tests, validations, or observations actually performed.
Next best: /qs-skill-name — why it is the best next step.
```

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, and **Next best**. Omit **Outputs** or **Checks** when none exist. List only skills that actually ran; a recommendation belongs under **Next best**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a check, artifact, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant follow-ons from:

- `/qs-help` — Orient the receiving session around the next appropriate workflow.
- `/qs-code-build` — Resume a clearly documented implementation or ticket.
- `/qs-plan-clarify` — Resume an unresolved decision before continuing implementation.

Explain why the recommendation advances the actual work. If the request is finished, say `Next best: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
