description: "Implement a piece of work based on a spec or set of tickets."

Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

Use /qs-test-tdd where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, use /qs-review-code to review the work.

Commit your work to the current branch.

## Completion report and next steps

Finish every invocation with an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout and a concise in-chat completion report. Resolve the QuickStark root by walking upward from this skill's `SKILL.md`; both the canonical repository and installed Codex plugin contain `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs`.

Write a small JSON input containing the actual skill, status, outcome, findings, decisions, real outputs, checks actually performed, and relevant next skills. Generate the readout with:

```bash
node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" render --input "<absolute-path-to-readout.json>"
```

The generator writes a uniquely named, self-contained HTML file to the OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` directory. If `QS_READOUT_BASE_URL` points to an already running private viewer, report the returned HTTP(S) link; otherwise report the real absolute HTML path. Preserve and link the skill's primary artifact when it produces one. Record a missing runtime, denied file access, or unavailable viewer honestly; do not start a public server, claim a reachable URL, or pretend a readout exists.

```text
Status: Completed | Awaiting input | Blocked
Skills used: /qs-code-build; /another-skill only if actually used
Outcome: What was completed, discovered, decided, or is blocking progress.
Readout: Real absolute HTML path or verified private viewer URL.
Outputs: Real files, reports, decisions, or changes, when applicable.
Checks: Only the tests, validations, or observations actually performed.
Next best: /qs-skill-name — why it is the best next step.
```

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, **Readout**, and **Next best**. When the readout cannot be created, state `Readout: Not created —` and the actual reason. Omit **Outputs** or **Checks** when none exist. List only skills that actually ran; a recommendation belongs under **Next best**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a check, artifact, URL, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant follow-ons from:

- `/qs-test-tdd` — Add or complete behavior-focused coverage for the implemented change.
- `/qs-review-code` — Review the implementation against its requirements and standards.
- `/qs-deploy-release` — Release a reviewed change using the project's documented workflow.

Explain why the recommendation advances the actual work. If the request is finished, say `Next best: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
