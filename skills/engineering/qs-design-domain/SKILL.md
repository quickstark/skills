# QS Design: Domain

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline — challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is not this skill — that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `CONTEXT.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).

## Completion report and next steps

Finish every invocation with an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout and a concise in-chat completion report. Resolve the QuickStark root by walking upward from this skill's `SKILL.md`; both the canonical repository and installed Codex plugin contain `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs`.

Write a small JSON input containing the actual skill, status, outcome, findings, decisions, real outputs, checks actually performed, and up to three relevant `nextSkills` objects containing `name`, `reason`, and a copy-ready `prompt`. Each prompt explicitly invokes its catalog-approved skill and carries forward the actual outcome, findings, decisions, outputs, and checks relevant to that follow-on. Use the Codex-native `$qs-...` skill spelling for automatically generated follow-on prompts; existing explicit `/qs-...` prompts remain supported. A resolved blue skill mention is controlled by the Codex composer and its skill picker, not by HTML, Markdown, clipboard text, or the readout viewer. Present each full prompt in its own fenced text code block. Put its suggested model and thinking level in a visually muted callout underneath. Optionally supply `model`, `thinking`, and `modelReason` when the actual remaining work justifies a more specific heuristic suggestion. Record only directly verified execution context, delivery provenance, or relationships.

Include `commands` only when the user actually needs to run an installation, debugging, verification, setup, or other terminal command after the skill completes. Each recorded command must contain a concise `title`, the exact copyable `command`, and a `detail` explaining why or when the user should run it. Never present already executed checks, execution logs, or the skill's own command transcript as pending user actions. Include `keyCode` only for an actual source excerpt the user needs to inspect, using a concise `title`, exact `code`, a safe `language`, and an optional repository-relative `path` and explanatory `detail`. Render both as separate, safely escaped code blocks. Omit both sections when no user action or noteworthy code exists. Never expose secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, sensitive files, speculative instructions, or invented code; previews cannot claim commands or recorded source.

Generate the readout with:

```bash
node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" render --require-hosted --input "<absolute-path-to-readout.json>"
```

Every actual promoted skill must use `render --require-hosted` and present only its verified `https://reports.quickstark.com/` report URL. Never substitute a temporary filesystem path, localhost, a private-IP viewer, or an editor-opening attachment. To automatically publish every actual skill report from Linux, macOS, or Windows, `QS_READOUT_PRODUCER_TOKEN` remains the only required setting when no securely installed profile credential is available. On Linux and Windows the renderer first uses a valid explicit token. On macOS it first securely discovers the owner-only file or named Keychain credential belonging to the current `.codex` or `.codex-demo` profile, so an inherited shared desktop token never replaces another profile's producer; the valid explicit token remains the fallback when that profile has neither credential. Standard private machine files and the legacy macOS Keychain entry remain supported. Never read another user's profile, follow a profile or credential-ancestor symlink, expose a credential, or silently replace one profile's producer identity. The reports API authenticates the token and derives the producer identity. The renderer automatically uses `https://reports.quickstark.com/api/v1/readouts`, identifies the Codex harness, and derives the project from the skill's actual working directory, using its Git origin when available or a safely fingerprinted local workspace when no remote exists. Do not configure project names, owners, producer identifiers, or harness metadata for ordinary skill runs. Token authentication, not GitHub ownership, authorizes publication; never mislabel a report as a different project or expose an absolute local path. Hosted-only rendering writes an immutable local recovery report without starting a private-IP viewer and returns the hosted domain URL only after authenticated acceptance. A missing credential, unavailable token, unsafe project, rejected producer, or failed hosted delivery must fail clearly; preserve the recovery report but never present its local path or a private viewer as the skill result. Explicit local, LAN, or SSH viewers remain available only when the user deliberately requests local access instead of normal hosted skill reporting. Never commit, print, reuse across security boundaries, or embed a bearer token in a report.
Include an optional `observation` only for directly observed Codex or provider measurements. A clearly identified `skill-run` may display its actual model, reasoning effort, final-response token counts, and active duration in the compact Skill run metrics section immediately after Top next prompts. Display unavailable values as `Not captured`; never estimate usage, promote a suggested configuration into a measurement, or attribute thread-turn or cumulative telemetry to an individual skill. An unrun preview never displays skill-run metrics.

Only when a user explicitly requests local access, the renderer automatically starts or reuses a verified readout viewer, selects an available port, and writes a uniquely named, self-contained HTML file. Ordinary promoted skill completions never use that viewer. Every promoted skill selects its own compact, purpose-specific report profile; accessible concept maps, evidence charts, review matrices, and check summaries visualize only actual recorded results. OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` storage remains the default for private recovery artifacts. Set `QS_READOUT_DIR=/docker/appdata/quickstark-readouts` to opt into the durable, project-organized report library; verified Git identities automatically group immutable reports by project, year, and month. Its full-height, project-first Project Workbench integrates verified project navigation, searchable actual skill runs, and complete immutable readouts in one responsive page. Explicit private viewing on macOS or a graphical desktop uses localhost; explicitly requested headless Linux viewing can use a protected private home-network address. Tailscale is not required. Set `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=ssh` or pass `--access ssh` only for deliberately requested SSH forwarding, or use `--access local` for deliberately requested local-only access.

The renderer automatically captures the actual execution machine and platform for every real skill run. Add `execution.deployments` only for directly observed environments, deployment states, and safe verified HTTP(S) URLs. Add `execution.files` only for repository-relative files this skill actually added, modified, deleted, or renamed, with a concise accurate change summary. Preserve unrelated existing work; never infer run-owned files from an already dirty worktree or expose secrets, `.env` files, credentials, absolute machine paths, or unverified deployment targets. Previews never claim an execution machine, deployment, or changed file.

When this run actually touches GitHub, a merge, or a release, add an optional `provenance` object containing only observed `pullRequests`, `closedIssues`, `release`, and `commit`. Verify GitHub numbers, record state, HTTPS links, repository ownership, release version, and complete Git hash. Set `commit.published` only after confirming remote publication; set `closedByRelease` only after independently confirming that exact release closed the issue. Omit missing evidence entirely. Record `relationships` only between observed findings, decisions, outputs, or checks; review findings may carry their actual `standards` or `specification` axis and `P0`–`P3` priority. Previews never contain delivery provenance or observed relationships.

Report only the independently verified `https://reports.quickstark.com/` skill-readout URL. A standalone visual artifact can be retained as private internal source evidence; publish it with `node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" visual --skill "<actual-skill>" --input "<absolute-path-to-visual.html>" --json` only when the returned independently verified HTTP(S) browser URL is actually on `reports.quickstark.com`. If no safe hosted visual publication exists, omit its link and make the hosted skill readout the primary architecture report. Never present a `/tmp` or `/var/folders` filesystem path, `file:` link, localhost, private-IP URL, or editor-opening HTML attachment as the skill's report. Record a missing runtime, denied file access, unavailable producer credential, or failed hosted publication honestly; do not bind to every network interface, claim an unreachable URL, or pretend a hosted readout or browser visual exists.

**Top next prompts:**

**1. Recommended continuation**

Design software boundaries using the clarified domain vocabulary.

```text
Use $qs-design-modules to design a clean, deep, and testable module for this problem.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`

Use the same fenced-prompt and muted callout format for at most two genuinely relevant alternatives.

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, **Execution**, **Readout**, and **Top next prompts**. Make each complete, copy-ready prompt the visual focus in a fenced text code block. Place **Suggested model** and **Suggested thinking** underneath in a muted blockquote callout, label both as heuristic, and never change the active model or thinking level. These suggestions are not observed run measurements, comparative benchmarks, independently verified quality, or automatic model changes. When the readout cannot be created, state `Readout: Not created —` and the actual reason. Omit deployment details, changed files, **Outputs**, **Checks**, **Commands**, **Key code**, or **Delivery** when no corresponding evidence exists. List only skills that actually ran; suggested prompts belong under **Top next prompts**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a machine, check, changed file, artifact, issue, pull request, release, URL, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant, copy-ready prompt directions from:

**1. `/qs-design-modules`**

Design software boundaries using the clarified domain vocabulary.

```text
Use $qs-design-modules to design a clean, deep, and testable module for this problem.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Module design benefits from carefully reasoning about interfaces and seams.

**2. `/qs-plan-clarify`**

Use the domain model to settle feature or refactoring requirements.

```text
Use $qs-plan-clarify to clarify this project and document the resulting decisions.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Clarification benefits from deeper reasoning about requirements and trade-offs.

**3. `/qs-plan-spec`**

Write the specification in the project's agreed domain language.

```text
Use $qs-plan-spec to turn the agreed requirements into an actionable specification.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: A specification benefits from reconciling boundaries, decisions, and requirements.

Tailor every selected prompt to this run's actual outcome and recorded evidence; the catalog wording is a starting point, not a substitute for the accomplished work. Explain why the prompt advances the actual remaining work. If the request is finished, say `Top next prompts: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
