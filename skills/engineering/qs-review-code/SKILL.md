name: qs-review-code
description: Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along two axes — Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/PRD asked for?). Runs both reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to "review since X".
---

Two-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point the user supplies:

- **Standards** — does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec** — does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / PRD / spec?

Both axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you — run `/qs-setup` if `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` is missing.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point — a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc. If they didn't specify one, ask for it.

Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here — not inside two parallel sub-agents.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.) — fetch via the workflow in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. A path the user passed as an argument.
3. A PRD/spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below — a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation — and, like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Spawn both sub-agents in parallel

Send a single message with two `Agent` tool calls. Use the `general-purpose` subagent for both.

**Standards sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full — the sub-agent has no other access to it.
- The brief: "Report — per file/hunk where relevant — (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls — documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** — include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

### 5. Aggregate

Present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Do **not** merge or rerank findings — the two axes are deliberately separate (see _Why two axes_).

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue _within each axis_ (if any). Don't pick a single winner across axes — that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

### 6. Surface the actual delivery decision

When actionable findings or failed checks remain, recommend `/qs-code-build` or `/qs-test-tdd`; do not suggest merging a failing change. When both independent review axes are clean and the observed checks pass, inspect the current branch, tracked remote, ahead/behind state, and any actual GitHub pull request. Recommend `$qs-git-merge` to complete only the verified, explicitly authorized integration or publication path. A commit already on `main` and ahead of `origin/main` requires an approved `git push origin main`, not a nonexistent branch merge. Treat `/qs-deploy-release` as a separate, explicitly approved release; never claim a PR, merge, published commit, or release without independently verifying it.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.

## Completion report and next steps

Finish every invocation with an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout and a concise in-chat completion report. Resolve the QuickStark root by walking upward from this skill's `SKILL.md`; both the canonical repository and installed Codex plugin contain `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs`.

Write a small JSON input containing the actual skill, status, outcome, findings, decisions, real outputs, checks actually performed, and up to three relevant `nextSkills` objects containing `name`, `reason`, and a copy-ready `prompt`. Each prompt explicitly invokes its catalog-approved skill and carries forward the actual outcome, findings, decisions, outputs, and checks relevant to that follow-on. Use the Codex-native `$qs-...` skill spelling for automatically generated follow-on prompts; existing explicit `/qs-...` prompts remain supported. A resolved blue skill mention is controlled by the Codex composer and its skill picker, not by HTML, Markdown, clipboard text, or the readout viewer. Present each full prompt in its own fenced text code block. Put its suggested model and thinking level in a visually muted callout underneath. Optionally supply `model`, `thinking`, and `modelReason` when the actual remaining work justifies a more specific heuristic suggestion. Record only directly verified execution context, delivery provenance, or relationships.

Include `commands` only when the user actually needs to run an installation, debugging, verification, setup, or other terminal command after the skill completes. Each recorded command must contain a concise `title`, the exact copyable `command`, and a `detail` explaining why or when the user should run it. Never present already executed checks, execution logs, or the skill's own command transcript as pending user actions. Include `keyCode` only for an actual source excerpt the user needs to inspect, using a concise `title`, exact `code`, a safe `language`, and an optional repository-relative `path` and explanatory `detail`. Render both as separate, safely escaped code blocks. Omit both sections when no user action or noteworthy code exists. Never expose secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, sensitive files, speculative instructions, or invented code; previews cannot claim commands or recorded source.

Generate the readout with:

```bash
node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" render --input "<absolute-path-to-readout.json>"
```

To automatically publish every actual skill report from Linux, macOS, or Windows, `QS_READOUT_PRODUCER_TOKEN` remains the only required setting when no securely installed profile credential is available. On Linux and Windows the renderer first uses a valid explicit token. On macOS it first securely discovers the owner-only file or named Keychain credential belonging to the current `.codex` or `.codex-demo` profile, so an inherited shared desktop token never replaces another profile's producer; the valid explicit token remains the fallback when that profile has neither credential. Standard private machine files and the legacy macOS Keychain entry remain supported. Never read another user's profile, follow a profile or credential-ancestor symlink, expose a credential, or silently replace one profile's producer identity. The reports API authenticates the token and derives the producer identity. The renderer automatically uses `https://reports.quickstark.com/api/v1/readouts`, identifies the Codex harness, and derives the project from the skill's actual working directory, using its Git origin when available or a safely fingerprinted local workspace when no remote exists. Do not configure project names, owners, producer identifiers, or harness metadata for ordinary skill runs. Token authentication, not GitHub ownership, authorizes publication; never mislabel a report as a different project or expose an absolute local path. The ordinary render command writes an immutable local report, publishes the structured result without starting a private-IP viewer, and returns the hosted reports URL only after authenticated delivery succeeds. Explicit local, LAN, or SSH viewer requests remain private. Never commit, print, reuse across security boundaries, or embed a bearer token in a report. If the private token, safe current-project identity, or hosted delivery is unavailable, preserve the local report and report the actual failure.
Include an optional `observation` only for directly observed Codex or provider measurements. A clearly identified `skill-run` may display its actual model, reasoning effort, final-response token counts, and active duration in the compact Skill run metrics section immediately after Top next prompts. Display unavailable values as `Not captured`; never estimate usage, promote a suggested configuration into a measurement, or attribute thread-turn or cumulative telemetry to an individual skill. An unrun preview never displays skill-run metrics.

The render command automatically starts or reuses a verified readout viewer, selects an available port, and writes a uniquely named, self-contained HTML file. Every promoted skill selects its own compact, purpose-specific report profile; accessible concept maps, evidence charts, review matrices, and check summaries visualize only actual recorded results. OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` storage remains the default. Set `QS_READOUT_DIR=/docker/appdata/quickstark-readouts` to opt into the durable, project-organized report library; verified Git identities automatically group immutable reports by project, year, and month. Its full-height, project-first Project Workbench integrates verified project navigation, searchable actual skill runs, and complete immutable readouts in one responsive page. On macOS or a graphical desktop the private viewer uses localhost. On a headless or SSH-connected Linux dev box it detects the private home-network IP, binds only to that address, protects the viewer with an unguessable URL, and returns a clickable report for a laptop on the same home network. Tailscale is not required. Set `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=ssh` to keep a remote viewer on localhost for explicit SSH forwarding, or `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=local` for local-only access.

The renderer automatically captures the actual execution machine and platform for every real skill run. Add `execution.deployments` only for directly observed environments, deployment states, and safe verified HTTP(S) URLs. Add `execution.files` only for repository-relative files this skill actually added, modified, deleted, or renamed, with a concise accurate change summary. Preserve unrelated existing work; never infer run-owned files from an already dirty worktree or expose secrets, `.env` files, credentials, absolute machine paths, or unverified deployment targets. Previews never claim an execution machine, deployment, or changed file.

When this run actually touches GitHub, a merge, or a release, add an optional `provenance` object containing only observed `pullRequests`, `closedIssues`, `release`, and `commit`. Verify GitHub numbers, record state, HTTPS links, repository ownership, release version, and complete Git hash. Set `commit.published` only after confirming remote publication; set `closedByRelease` only after independently confirming that exact release closed the issue. Omit missing evidence entirely. Record `relationships` only between observed findings, decisions, outputs, or checks; review findings may carry their actual `standards` or `specification` axis and `P0`–`P3` priority. Previews never contain delivery provenance or observed relationships.

Report the verified HTTP(S) readout URL and preserve the real HTML path. When a skill produces a standalone visual artifact, publish its primary visual with `node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" visual --skill "<actual-skill>" --input "<absolute-path-to-visual.html>" --json`; use the returned, independently verified HTTP(S) browser URL as the primary visual link. Never present a `/tmp` filesystem path, `file:` link, or editor-opening HTML attachment as a website. Preserve the source path as secondary evidence, not as the browser destination. Record a missing runtime, denied file access, unavailable home-network route, or failed viewer health check honestly; do not bind to every network interface, claim an unreachable URL, or pretend a readout or browser visual exists.

**Top next prompts:**

**1. Recommended continuation**

Address actionable findings before the change is considered complete.

```text
Use $qs-code-build to implement this specification or ticket with appropriate tests.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`

> Heuristic: Implementation benefits from sustained reasoning and direct verification. Never change the active model or thinking level.

Use the same fenced-prompt and muted callout format for at most two genuinely relevant alternatives.

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, **Execution**, **Readout**, and **Top next prompts**. Make each complete, copy-ready prompt the visual focus in a fenced text code block. Place **Suggested model** and **Suggested thinking** underneath in a muted blockquote callout, label both as heuristic, and never change the active model or thinking level. These suggestions are not observed run measurements, comparative benchmarks, independently verified quality, or automatic model changes. When the readout cannot be created, state `Readout: Not created —` and the actual reason. Omit deployment details, changed files, **Outputs**, **Checks**, **Commands**, **Key code**, or **Delivery** when no corresponding evidence exists. List only skills that actually ran; suggested prompts belong under **Top next prompts**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a machine, check, changed file, artifact, issue, pull request, release, URL, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant, copy-ready prompt directions from:

**1. `/qs-code-build`**

Address actionable findings before the change is considered complete.

```text
Use $qs-code-build to implement this specification or ticket with appropriate tests.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Implementation benefits from sustained reasoning and direct verification.

**2. `/qs-git-merge`**

Verify the branch, pull request, integration, and GitHub publication required for the reviewed change.

```text
Use $qs-git-merge to verify and complete the actual Git integration, pull request, or GitHub publication.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: GitHub integration benefits from verifying branch state, publication, pull requests, and competing changes.

**3. `/qs-deploy-release`**

Release an approved change after all required checks pass.

```text
Use $qs-deploy-release to verify and run this project's documented release workflow.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: An approved release benefits from deliberate prerequisite and smoke-test checks.

Tailor every selected prompt to this run's actual outcome and recorded evidence; the catalog wording is a starting point, not a substitute for the accomplished work. Explain why the prompt advances the actual remaining work. If the request is finished, say `Top next prompts: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
