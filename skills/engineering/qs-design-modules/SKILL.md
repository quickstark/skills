# QS Design: Modules

Design **deep modules**: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface, placed at a clean seam, testable through that interface. Use this language and these principles wherever code is being designed or restructured. The aim is leverage for callers, locality for maintainers, and testability for everyone.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly — don't substitute "component," "service," "API," or "boundary." Consistent language is the whole point.

**Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation. Deliberately scale-agnostic: a function, class, package, or tier-spanning slice. _Avoid_: unit, component, service.

**Interface** — everything a caller must know to use the module correctly: the type signature, but also invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, required configuration, and performance characteristics. _Avoid_: API, signature (too narrow — they refer only to the type-level surface).

**Implementation** — what's inside a module, its body of code. Distinct from **Adapter**: a thing can be a small adapter with a large implementation (a Postgres repo) or a large adapter with a small implementation (an in-memory fake). Reach for "adapter" when the seam is the topic; "implementation" otherwise.

**Depth** — leverage at the interface: the amount of behaviour a caller (or test) can exercise per unit of interface they have to learn. A module is **deep** when a large amount of behaviour sits behind a small interface, **shallow** when the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation.

**Seam** _(Michael Feathers)_ — a place where you can alter behaviour without editing in that place; the *location* at which a module's interface lives. Where to put the seam is its own design decision, distinct from what goes behind it. _Avoid_: boundary (overloaded with DDD's bounded context).

**Adapter** — a concrete thing that satisfies an interface at a seam. Describes *role* (what slot it fills), not substance (what's inside).

**Leverage** — what callers get from depth: more capability per unit of interface they learn. One implementation pays back across N call sites and M tests.

**Locality** — what maintainers get from depth: change, bugs, knowledge, and verification concentrate in one place rather than spreading across callers. Fix once, fixed everywhere.

## Deep vs shallow

**Deep module** = small interface + lots of implementation:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Small Interface   │  ← Few methods, simple params
├─────────────────────┤
│                     │
│  Deep Implementation│  ← Complex logic hidden
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Shallow module** = large interface + little implementation (avoid):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│       Large Interface           │  ← Many methods, complex params
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Thin Implementation            │  ← Just passes through
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

When designing an interface, ask:

- Can I reduce the number of methods?
- Can I simplify the parameters?
- Can I hide more complexity inside?

## Principles

- **Depth is a property of the interface, not the implementation.** A deep module can be internally composed of small, mockable, swappable parts — they just aren't part of the interface. A module can have **internal seams** (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the **external seam** at its interface.
- **The deletion test.** Imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.** Callers and tests cross the same seam. If you want to test *past* the interface, the module is probably the wrong shape.
- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a seam unless something actually varies across it.

## Designing for testability

Good interfaces make testing natural:

1. **Accept dependencies, don't create them.**

   ```typescript
   // Testable
   function processOrder(order, paymentGateway) {}

   // Hard to test
   function processOrder(order) {
     const gateway = new StripeGateway();
   }
   ```

2. **Return results, don't produce side effects.**

   ```typescript
   // Testable
   function calculateDiscount(cart): Discount {}

   // Hard to test
   function applyDiscount(cart): void {
     cart.total -= discount;
   }
   ```

3. **Small surface area.** Fewer methods = fewer tests needed. Fewer params = simpler test setup.

## Relationships

- A **Module** has exactly one **Interface** (the surface it presents to callers and tests).
- **Depth** is a property of a **Module**, measured against its **Interface**.
- A **Seam** is where a **Module**'s **Interface** lives.
- An **Adapter** sits at a **Seam** and satisfies the **Interface**.
- **Depth** produces **Leverage** for callers and **Locality** for maintainers.

## Rejected framings

- **Depth as ratio of implementation-lines to interface-lines** (Ousterhout): rewards padding the implementation. We use depth-as-leverage instead.
- **"Interface" as the TypeScript `interface` keyword or a class's public methods**: too narrow — interface here includes every fact a caller must know.
- **"Boundary"**: overloaded with DDD's bounded context. Say **seam** or **interface**.

## Going deeper

- **Deepening a cluster given its dependencies** — see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md): dependency categories, seam discipline, and replace-don't-layer testing.
- **Exploring alternative interfaces** — see [DESIGN-IT-TWICE.md](DESIGN-IT-TWICE.md): spin up parallel sub-agents to design the interface several radically different ways, then compare on depth, locality, and seam placement.

## Completion report and next steps

Finish every invocation with an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout and a concise in-chat completion report. Resolve the QuickStark root by walking upward from this skill's `SKILL.md`; both the canonical repository and installed Codex plugin contain `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs`.

Write a small JSON input containing the actual skill, status, outcome, findings, decisions, real outputs, checks actually performed, and relevant next skills. Generate the readout with:

```bash
node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" render --input "<absolute-path-to-readout.json>"
```

The render command automatically starts or reuses a verified readout viewer, selects an available port, and writes a uniquely named, self-contained HTML file to the OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` directory. On macOS or a graphical desktop it uses localhost. On a headless or SSH-connected Linux dev box it detects the private home-network IP, binds only to that address, protects the viewer with an unguessable URL, and returns a clickable report for a laptop on the same home network. Tailscale is not required. Set `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=ssh` to keep a remote viewer on localhost for explicit SSH forwarding, or `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=local` for local-only access.

Report the verified HTTP(S) readout URL and preserve the real HTML path. Preserve and link the skill's primary artifact when it produces one. Record a missing runtime, denied file access, unavailable home-network route, or failed viewer health check honestly; do not bind to every network interface, claim an unreachable URL, or pretend a readout exists.

```text
Status: Completed | Awaiting input | Blocked
Skills used: /qs-design-modules; /another-skill only if actually used
Outcome: What was completed, discovered, decided, or is blocking progress.
Readout: Real absolute HTML path or verified private viewer URL.
Outputs: Real files, reports, decisions, or changes, when applicable.
Checks: Only the tests, validations, or observations actually performed.
Next best: /qs-skill-name — why it is the best next step.
```

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, **Readout**, and **Next best**. When the readout cannot be created, state `Readout: Not created —` and the actual reason. Omit **Outputs** or **Checks** when none exist. List only skills that actually ran; a recommendation belongs under **Next best**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a check, artifact, URL, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant follow-ons from:

- `/qs-test-tdd` — Protect the selected module seam with a behavior-first test.
- `/qs-plan-spec` — Document a significant interface or refactoring decision.
- `/qs-code-build` — Implement the agreed module design.

Explain why the recommendation advances the actual work. If the request is finished, say `Next best: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
