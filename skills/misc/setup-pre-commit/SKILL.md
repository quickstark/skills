description: Set up Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged (Prettier), type checking, and tests in the current repo. Use when user wants to add pre-commit hooks, set up Husky, configure lint-staged, or add commit-time formatting/typechecking/testing.

# Setup Pre-Commit Hooks

## What This Sets Up

- **Husky** pre-commit hook
- **lint-staged** running Prettier on all staged files
- **Prettier** config (if missing)
- **typecheck** and **test** scripts in the pre-commit hook

## Steps

### 1. Detect package manager

Check for `package-lock.json` (npm), `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm), `yarn.lock` (yarn), `bun.lockb` (bun). Use whichever is present. Default to npm if unclear.

### 2. Install dependencies

Install as devDependencies:

```
husky lint-staged prettier
```

### 3. Initialize Husky

```bash
npx husky init
```

This creates `.husky/` dir and adds `prepare: "husky"` to package.json.

### 4. Create `.husky/pre-commit`

Write this file (no shebang needed for Husky v9+):

```
npx lint-staged
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

**Adapt**: Replace `npm` with detected package manager. If repo has no `typecheck` or `test` script in package.json, omit those lines and tell the user.

### 5. Create `.lintstagedrc`

```json
{
  "*": "prettier --ignore-unknown --write"
}
```

### 6. Create `.prettierrc` (if missing)

Only create if no Prettier config exists. Use these defaults:

```json
{
  "useTabs": false,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 80,
  "singleQuote": false,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "semi": true,
  "arrowParens": "always"
}
```

### 7. Verify

- [ ] `.husky/pre-commit` exists and is executable
- [ ] `.lintstagedrc` exists
- [ ] `prepare` script in package.json is `"husky"`
- [ ] `prettier` config exists
- [ ] Run `npx lint-staged` to verify it works

### 8. Commit

Stage all changed/created files and commit with message: `Add pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged + prettier)`

This will run through the new pre-commit hooks — a good smoke test that everything works.

## Notes

- Husky v9+ doesn't need shebangs in hook files
- `prettier --ignore-unknown` skips files Prettier can't parse (images, etc.)
- The pre-commit runs lint-staged first (fast, staged-only), then full typecheck and tests

## Progress reporting

Keep a checklist in the conversation. Report the current stage and estimated stage and overall completion, whether progress is continuing, and whether you need anything from me. Verify each completed stage. Finish with a short explanation of what was configured, which checks passed, and what remains.

Start with a concise checklist of meaningful stages; one stage is enough for a short task. Label stages pending, active, verified, skipped, blocked, or failed. Only verified stages receive completed checkboxes; explain skipped stages. Verify each stage against relevant artifacts, command results, sources, or observable behavior before checking it off. A failing required check prevents completion; reopen a verified stage when later evidence invalidates it.

During long operations, aim for updates within sixty seconds when the host allows control to return. State the current stage, observed progress or waiting state, and whether user input is needed. Distinguish a process that is running from confirmed progress; elapsed time alone proves neither progress nor completion. Finish with what changed or was configured, checks passed or failed, and remaining work. Read-only runs describe findings without implying mutations. Apply this contract regardless of effort or report mode; brief output may compress evidence but retains blockers and failed checks.

Report at task start, meaningful stage transitions, material progress changes, blockers, resumption, and completion. Use: `Stage: <name> | Stage estimate: ~<N>% | Overall estimate: ~<N>% | <state> — <observed progress or waiting>. Input needed: <none or exact need>`. Overall means the bounded root task for a standalone skill, or the entire authorized goal for a submitted multi-stage workflow. Within a goal, label a root's own completion separately; finishing one root does not make the goal 100% complete.

Assign meaningful stages approximate effort weights at the start and compute overall progress as sum(weight × stage estimate) / sum(in-scope weights). Base stage estimates on verified milestones, observed partial work, and remaining effort; checklist item counts, elapsed time, token consumption, or a running process alone are not progress. Use coarse estimates without decimal precision and explain low confidence. Keep weights stable unless evidence changes the work breakdown; explain recalibration, added work, reopened checks, and any decrease. Explain skipped stages: remove out-of-scope work from the denominator without awarding credit, and credit previously satisfied in-scope work only with current verification evidence; a skipped label alone earns nothing. Helpers contribute evidence to their parent's estimate without separate public reports or double-counting.

Keep the last defensible estimate while waiting or blocked unless evidence changes it; state the required input or external event. Preserve the scope, weights, estimates, and supporting revision/evidence for resumption; reuse only still-valid evidence and reopen invalidated checks. Never reset valid progress or count resumed work twice. Reserve stage 100% for verified stage completion and overall 100% for verified completion of the whole stated scope. Cap unverified estimates at 95% when rounding to coarse values so rounding cannot imply completion. Failed required checks, unresolved acceptance criteria, or actionable P0/P1 findings prohibit completion regardless of the estimate. Percentages never override status or verification gates.
