# Scaffold Exercises

Create exercise directory structures that pass `pnpm ai-hero-cli internal lint`, then commit with `git commit`.

## Directory naming

- **Sections**: `XX-section-name/` inside `exercises/` (e.g., `01-retrieval-skill-building`)
- **Exercises**: `XX.YY-exercise-name/` inside a section (e.g., `01.03-retrieval-with-bm25`)
- Section number = `XX`, exercise number = `XX.YY`
- Names are dash-case (lowercase, hyphens)

## Exercise variants

Each exercise needs at least one of these subfolders:

- `problem/` - student workspace with TODOs
- `solution/` - reference implementation
- `explainer/` - conceptual material, no TODOs

When stubbing, default to `explainer/` unless the plan specifies otherwise.

## Required files

Each subfolder (`problem/`, `solution/`, `explainer/`) needs a `readme.md` that:

- Is **not empty** (must have real content, even a single title line works)
- Has no broken links

When stubbing, create a minimal readme with a title and a description:

```md
# Exercise Title

Description here
```

If the subfolder has code, it also needs a `main.ts` (>1 line). But for stubs, a readme-only exercise is fine.

## Workflow

1. **Parse the plan** - extract section names, exercise names, and variant types
2. **Create directories** - `mkdir -p` for each path
3. **Create stub readmes** - one `readme.md` per variant folder with a title
4. **Run lint** - `pnpm ai-hero-cli internal lint` to validate
5. **Fix any errors** - iterate until lint passes

## Lint rules summary

The linter (`pnpm ai-hero-cli internal lint`) checks:

- Each exercise has subfolders (`problem/`, `solution/`, `explainer/`)
- At least one of `problem/`, `explainer/`, or `explainer.1/` exists
- `readme.md` exists and is non-empty in the primary subfolder
- No `.gitkeep` files
- No `speaker-notes.md` files
- No broken links in readmes
- No `pnpm run exercise` commands in readmes
- `main.ts` required per subfolder unless it's readme-only

## Moving/renaming exercises

When renumbering or moving exercises:

1. Use `git mv` (not `mv`) to rename directories - preserves git history
2. Update the numeric prefix to maintain order
3. Re-run lint after moves

Example:

```bash
git mv exercises/01-retrieval/01.03-embeddings exercises/01-retrieval/01.04-embeddings
```

## Example: stubbing from a plan

Given a plan like:

```
Section 05: Memory Skill Building
- 05.01 Introduction to Memory
- 05.02 Short-term Memory (explainer + problem + solution)
- 05.03 Long-term Memory
```

Create:

```bash
mkdir -p exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.01-introduction-to-memory/explainer
mkdir -p exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.02-short-term-memory/{explainer,problem,solution}
mkdir -p exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.03-long-term-memory/explainer
```

Then create readme stubs:

```
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.01-introduction-to-memory/explainer/readme.md -> "# Introduction to Memory"
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.02-short-term-memory/explainer/readme.md -> "# Short-term Memory"
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.02-short-term-memory/problem/readme.md -> "# Short-term Memory"
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.02-short-term-memory/solution/readme.md -> "# Short-term Memory"
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.03-long-term-memory/explainer/readme.md -> "# Long-term Memory"
```

## Progress reporting

Keep a checklist in the conversation. Report the current stage and estimated stage and overall completion, whether progress is continuing, and whether you need anything from me. Verify each completed stage. Finish with a short explanation of what was configured, which checks passed, and what remains.

Start with a concise checklist of meaningful stages; one stage is enough for a short task. Label stages pending, active, verified, skipped, blocked, or failed. Only verified stages receive completed checkboxes; explain skipped stages. Verify each stage against relevant artifacts, command results, sources, or observable behavior before checking it off. A failing required check prevents completion; reopen a verified stage when later evidence invalidates it.

During long operations, aim for updates within sixty seconds when the host allows control to return. State the current stage, observed progress or waiting state, and whether user input is needed. Distinguish a process that is running from confirmed progress; elapsed time alone proves neither progress nor completion. Finish with what changed or was configured, checks passed or failed, and remaining work. Read-only runs describe findings without implying mutations. Apply this contract regardless of effort or report mode; brief output may compress evidence but retains blockers and failed checks.

Report at task start, meaningful stage transitions, material progress changes, blockers, resumption, and completion. Use: `Stage: <name> | Stage estimate: ~<N>% | Overall estimate: ~<N>% | <state> — <observed progress or waiting>. Input needed: <none or exact need>`. Overall means the bounded root task for a standalone skill, or the entire authorized goal for a submitted multi-stage workflow. Within a goal, label a root's own completion separately; finishing one root does not make the goal 100% complete.

Assign meaningful stages approximate effort weights at the start and compute overall progress as sum(weight × stage estimate) / sum(in-scope weights). Base stage estimates on verified milestones, observed partial work, and remaining effort; checklist item counts, elapsed time, token consumption, or a running process alone are not progress. Use coarse estimates without decimal precision and explain low confidence. Keep weights stable unless evidence changes the work breakdown; explain recalibration, added work, reopened checks, and any decrease. Explain skipped stages: remove out-of-scope work from the denominator without awarding credit, and credit previously satisfied in-scope work only with current verification evidence; a skipped label alone earns nothing. Helpers contribute evidence to their parent's estimate without separate public reports or double-counting.

Keep the last defensible estimate while waiting or blocked unless evidence changes it; state the required input or external event. Preserve the scope, weights, estimates, and supporting revision/evidence for resumption; reuse only still-valid evidence and reopen invalidated checks. Never reset valid progress or count resumed work twice. Reserve stage 100% for verified stage completion and overall 100% for verified completion of the whole stated scope. Cap unverified estimates at 95% when rounding to coarse values so rounding cannot imply completion. Failed required checks, unresolved acceptance criteria, or actionable P0/P1 findings prohibit completion regardless of the estimate. Percentages never override status or verification gates.
