# Create a verification workflow

Create only explicitly selected project-local verification assets. Do not change product behavior.

## Behavior

1. Discover repository conventions, existing harnesses, local skill locations, and permitted write scope.
2. If the required real harness or target behavior is unavailable, request the missing input before writing.
3. Define a host-neutral verification-driver interface: setup, execute, observe, compare, and clean up.
4. Create a feature map recording feature identity, setup, action, observable result, checks, and evidence.
5. Make checks rerunnable, bounded, deterministic where practical, and safe after partial failure.
6. Run the workflow against real artifacts and distinguish verification defects from product defects.

Use a declared local-skill convention when one exists; otherwise use a clearly named generic verification directory approved by the user. Never repair product source or automatically publish the assets.

## Completion report and next steps

This invocation has one root skill: `/ps-create-verification-skill`. Internal capabilities and bounded helpers stay inside this run and never appear as separately used skills. Present the result directly in chat and create no secondary result artifact or URL.

Normalize explicit flags first, then clear natural-language intent, then defaults. `effort=quick|standard|deep` controls evidence depth and defaults to `standard`; `report=brief|full` controls presentation and defaults to `brief`. Neither changes mutation authority.

Resolve governing work context from explicit input, referenced task history available in the host, repository specifications or ticket plans, and a verified tracker when configured. Do not treat completion of the current root as proof that the larger project is complete. Every result must include `Specs:` with clickable Markdown links to verified specifications; when none can be located, write `Specs: Not located` and never invent a link. Never omit `Specs:` or `Work summary:`.
Write `Work summary:` as a compact readout with `Finished —` naming the bounded outcome, meaningful validation, and material outputs, followed by `Next —` outlining up to three highest-priority verified pending or blocked tickets, specifications, issues, or grouped work items as `linked id — state — next action`. Group items only when they share the same state and next action. When no remaining item can be verified, write `Next — None verified after checking the linked specs, available task history, and tracker context.`

Use `complete`, `continuation-required`, `input-required`, or `failed`. The current root being `complete` does not prove that the larger project is complete. Emit at most one copy-ready next-work prompt when a distinct verified actionable item remains and an eligible route owns it. Failed required checks or actionable P0/P1 findings prohibit `complete`.

Eligible next routes: `/ps-maintain-verification-skill`, `/qs-review-code`, `/qs-git-merge`. Failure routes: `/qs-code-debug`, `/qs-review-code`, `/qs-flow-handoff`. Select one route only when it owns unfinished work. Do not recommend a review, verification, planning, diagnosis, or implementation step already completed without new evidence that it must be repeated.

Before responding, apply the internal clear-writing pass: lead with the outcome, use concrete nouns and verbs, preserve necessary qualifications and technical terms, and remove repetition. It never appears as another skill, status, or continuation.

Brief output always contains status, outcome, specs, the compact work summary with Finished and Next entries, noteworthy failed checks, material outputs, and the Next work prompt label. Full adds the evidence trail, never more prompts. Omit empty optional sections and routine success detail; never omit the required readout fields.

Status: Complete | Continuation required | Input required | Failed
Skills used: /ps-create-verification-skill
Outcome: Concise verified result.
Specs: verified specification link(s) | Not located
Work summary:
- Finished — exact bounded outcome, meaningful validation, and material outputs
- Next — up to three linked pending or blocked items with state and next action | None verified after checking available sources
Next work prompt: None | one copy-ready prompt in a fenced `text` block

Always write `Next work prompt:`. When a distinct verified actionable item exists, put one fenced `text` block beneath it beginning with its exact Codex literal ($ps-skills:ps-maintain-verification-skill, $qs-skills:qs-review-code, $qs-skills:qs-git-merge, $qs-skills:qs-code-debug, $qs-skills:qs-flow-handoff); Claude uses `/ps-maintain-verification-skill`, `/qs-review-code`, `/qs-git-merge`, `/qs-code-debug`, `/qs-flow-handoff`; Pi uses `/skill:ps-maintain-verification-skill`, `/skill:qs-review-code`, `/skill:qs-git-merge`, `/skill:qs-code-debug`, `/skill:qs-flow-handoff`. Name the exact verified ticket, specification, issue, or grouped work item it advances and carry forward only decisive evidence. Do not replace the fenced block with inline prose, a bare command, or a link. When `Next` lists a pending or blocked actionable item and an eligible route owns it, the fenced `text` prompt is required even when the current root is complete. Only when no eligible actionable item remains, write `Next work prompt: None — no follow-on needed.` The fenced prompt is copy-ready only; plain skill Markdown cannot request or guarantee an Add action. Keep model guidance outside the fence and never change the active model or reasoning setting.
