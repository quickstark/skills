## What it does

`qs-plan-tickets` breaks a plan, spec, or the current conversation into a set of **tickets** — each a tracer-bullet vertical slice — and publishes them to your configured tracker, with every ticket declaring the tickets that block it.

Every ticket is a **tracer bullet** — a thin *vertical* slice that cuts through all integration layers end-to-end (schema, API, UI, tests), never a horizontal slice of one layer. A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own, which is what makes each ticket safe to hand to an agent.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/qs-plan-tickets` — the agent won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for it once you have an agreed plan or a written spec and you want it split into tickets. Point it at the conversation, or pass a spec or issue reference and it fetches the body and comments first. If the change hasn't been written up as a spec yet, produce one first — for that, use [qs-plan-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec).

## Prerequisites

`qs-plan-tickets` publishes into your issue tracker, so [qs-setup](https://aihero.dev/skills-setup-matt-pocock-skills) must have configured the tracker and its triage label vocabulary for this repo first. On a real tracker it applies the ready-for-agent label as it publishes.

## One artifact, two readings

The blocking edges are the whole point. They make one set of tickets read two ways, depending on the tracker:

- **Local files** → one file per ticket under `.scratch/<feature>/issues/`, numbered blockers-first, the edges written as text. You work them top-to-bottom, by hand, staying in the loop.
- **A real tracker (GitHub, Linear)** → one issue per ticket, the edges as native blocking links (or sub-issues). Any ticket whose blockers are all done is on the **frontier** and can be grabbed — so several agents can run at once.

The edges live in the ticket regardless of medium; the medium only decides whether anything acts on them in parallel. `qs-plan-tickets` produces the artifact — how you run it (sequential by hand, or a parallel fleet) is up to you.

## Vertical slices, not horizontal ones

The whole skill turns on one distinction. A **horizontal** slice ships one layer of the change — all the schema, or all the API — and nothing works until every layer lands. A **vertical** slice, the tracer bullet, ships one narrow path through *every* layer at once, so it can be demoed the moment it's done.

Before slicing, `qs-plan-tickets` looks for prefactoring — "make the change easy, then make the easy change" — and orders that work first. It then quizzes you on the breakdown (granularity, blocking edges, what to merge or split) before publishing anything, and publishes blockers first so each ticket's "Blocked by" can reference a real ticket.

## The wide-refactor exception

One shape breaks the tracer-bullet rule: a **wide refactor** — a single mechanical change (rename a column, retype a shared symbol) whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so one edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. `qs-plan-tickets` slices it as **expand–contract** instead: expand (add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks), migrate (move call sites over in batches sized by blast radius, one ticket per batch, CI green throughout because the old form still exists), then contract (delete the old form once no caller remains). When even the batches can't stay green alone, they share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket, and green is promised only there.

## Output and next steps

`/qs-plan-tickets` automatically starts or reuses a private, health-checked readout viewer; generates an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout; and closes with the same concise report used across the collection: status, skills actually used, outcome, actual execution machine, the verified viewer link and real readout path, real outputs or checks where applicable, and up to three copy-ready top next prompts. Present each complete prompt prominently in its own fenced text code block and place its suggested model and suggested thinking underneath in a visually muted callout. Each prompt embeds its catalog-approved follow-on skill and builds on the actual outcome, findings, decisions, outputs, and checks rather than merely recommending a skill name. Automatically generated prompts use the Codex-native `$qs-...` skill spelling; legacy explicit `/qs-...` prompts remain valid. Only the Codex composer and its skill picker can resolve a native skill mention into a blue token; a report cannot manufacture that UI state. Model and thinking guidance are explicitly heuristic; they are not measured model performance and never change the active configuration. Each skill uses its own compact, purpose-specific visual report profile; charts, concept maps, review matrices, and check summaries represent only actual recorded results. Relevant runs can include verified deployment environments and URLs, repository-relative files actually changed, independently verified GitHub pull requests, actually closed issues, released versions, complete Git commit hashes, and explicitly observed visual relationships. Local commits are never labeled as published, and issue closure is never attributed to an unverified release. On a Mac the viewer uses localhost; on a headless or SSH-connected Linux dev box it uses a protected private home-network URL. Tailscale is not required. Its readout uses the shared `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs` generator and defaults to the OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` directory. Set `QS_READOUT_DIR=/docker/appdata/quickstark-readouts` to opt into durable, project-organized storage and open one full-height, project-first Project Workbench with verified project navigation, searchable actual skill runs, and complete immutable readouts. Catalog previews remain explicitly identified, and no report claims that a suggested skill has already run.

To automatically publish actual skill reports from Linux, macOS, or Windows, `QS_READOUT_PRODUCER_TOKEN` is the only required setting. Configure that authorized token privately; the reporting API derives the producer identity, while the skill automatically identifies the Codex harness and the project from its current working directory. Use the Git origin when available; otherwise derive a safe, stable local-workspace identity without revealing the absolute filesystem path. The default reports endpoint is `https://reports.quickstark.com/api/v1/readouts`; ordinary runs require no project list, owner pattern, producer identifier, harness setting, GitHub verification, Git remote, or locally running viewer. Generate the immutable local report first and present a hosted report URL only after authenticated acceptance. Never expose the private token, mislabel another project, accept unsafe project paths, or claim that a failed submission succeeded.
A completed report displays a compact Skill run metrics section near the top, immediately after Top next prompts. It shows actual skill-attributed model, reasoning effort, provider-reported input and output tokens, total tokens, and active duration only when the running harness or provider genuinely captured them. Show `Not captured` for unavailable values, preserve thread-level evidence under its actual scope, and never invent measurements or attach skill-run metrics to a catalog preview.

When this skill leaves a genuine user action, its readout may include `commands` containing the exact terminal command, a clear title, and a `detail` explaining why or when the user should run it. When actual source deserves attention, its readout may include `keyCode` containing the exact code, language, and optional safe repository-relative file path. Both appear as separate, copyable code blocks. Execution logs and already executed commands are not user instructions; omit both sections when they are not applicable. Never include secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, invented code, or speculative terminal instructions.

Depending on the actual completed work, tailor one to three top next prompts from:

**1. [`/qs-code-build`](https://github.com/quickstark/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/qs-code-build/SKILL.md)**

Implement the next unblocked ticket.

```text
Use $qs-code-build to implement this specification or ticket with appropriate tests.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Implementation benefits from sustained reasoning and direct verification.

**2. [`/qs-test-tdd`](https://github.com/quickstark/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/qs-test-tdd/SKILL.md)**

Establish the agreed test seam for a ticket before implementation.

```text
Use $qs-test-tdd to implement this behavior using a red-green test-driven loop.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Test-driven work benefits from reasoning through behavior and regression seams.

**3. [`/qs-flow-handoff`](https://github.com/quickstark/skills/blob/main/skills/productivity/qs-flow-handoff/SKILL.md)**

Transfer the next ticket and its context into a fresh session.

```text
Use $qs-flow-handoff to prepare a concise handoff so another session can continue this work.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `medium`
>
> Heuristic: A handoff benefits from concise preservation of verified state and decisions.

## Where it fits

`qs-plan-tickets` is a step in the main build chain:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → code-review
```

It sits between [qs-plan-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec), which hands it a settled spec with user stories to slice against, and [qs-code-build](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement), which builds each ticket, driving [qs-test-tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) internally to write the tests test-first, before its [qs-review-code](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) pass. Work the frontier one ticket per fresh context, clearing between them. When you're unsure which skill or flow fits, [qs-help](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes you.
