## What it does

`qs-code-build` builds the work described in a spec or a set of tickets — driving it through test-driven development, typechecking, and the full test suite, then handing off to review and committing to the current branch.

It does **not** decide what to build. The spec is already settled and the seams are already agreed; `qs-code-build` executes that plan rather than reopening it. It is the hands, not the head — the thinking happened upstream.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/qs-code-build` — the agent won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for it once the work is written down as a spec or split into tickets and you're ready to turn that into code. If the spec doesn't exist yet, write it first — for that, use [qs-plan-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec), or [qs-plan-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) to break a spec into tickets. If you just want to build something test-first without a full spec, drop to [qs-test-tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd) directly.

## Pre-agreed seams

The idea `qs-code-build` runs on is the **seam** — the stable interface a feature is tested at, chosen before any code is written. It doesn't invent seams mid-build; it uses the ones already picked (during [qs-plan-spec](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-spec)) and writes tests against them via [qs-test-tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd). Working at pre-agreed seams is what keeps the implementation honest: the tests target something durable, so the code underneath can move without the tests moving.

Around that core it keeps the loop tight — typecheck often, run single test files as it goes, run the whole suite once at the end — then closes out with a review pass and a commit to the current branch.

## Output and next steps

`/qs-code-build` automatically starts or reuses a private, health-checked readout viewer; generates an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout; and closes with the same concise report used across the collection: status, skills actually used, outcome, actual execution machine, the verified viewer link and real readout path, real outputs or checks where applicable, and up to three copy-ready top next prompts. Present each complete prompt prominently in its own fenced text code block and place its suggested model and suggested thinking underneath in a visually muted callout. Each prompt embeds its catalog-approved follow-on skill and builds on the actual outcome, findings, decisions, outputs, and checks rather than merely recommending a skill name. Automatically generated prompts use the Codex-native `$qs-...` skill spelling; legacy explicit `/qs-...` prompts remain valid. Only the Codex composer and its skill picker can resolve a native skill mention into a blue token; a report cannot manufacture that UI state. Model and thinking guidance are explicitly heuristic; they are not measured model performance and never change the active configuration. Each skill uses its own compact, purpose-specific visual report profile; charts, concept maps, review matrices, and check summaries represent only actual recorded results. Relevant runs can include verified deployment environments and URLs, repository-relative files actually changed, independently verified GitHub pull requests, actually closed issues, released versions, complete Git commit hashes, and explicitly observed visual relationships. Local commits are never labeled as published, and issue closure is never attributed to an unverified release. On a Mac the viewer uses localhost; on a headless or SSH-connected Linux dev box it uses a protected private home-network URL. Tailscale is not required. Its readout uses the shared `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs` generator and defaults to the OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` directory. Set `QS_READOUT_DIR=/docker/appdata/quickstark-readouts` to opt into durable, project-organized storage and open one full-height, project-first Project Workbench with verified project navigation, searchable actual skill runs, and complete immutable readouts. Catalog previews remain explicitly identified, and no report claims that a suggested skill has already run.

To automatically publish actual skill reports from Linux, macOS, or Windows, `QS_READOUT_PRODUCER_TOKEN` remains the only required setting when no owner-only profile credential is installed. Linux and Windows preserve valid explicit-token precedence. On macOS the renderer first selects the current `.codex` or `.codex-demo` profile's private file or named Keychain token so a shared desktop environment cannot replace that profile's producer; the valid explicit token remains supported when neither profile credential exists. A safely installed machine token and the legacy macOS Keychain entry remain supported. Reject user-home escapes and symbolic links in every profile or credential ancestor. The reporting API derives the producer identity, while the skill automatically identifies the Codex harness and the project from its current working directory. Use the Git origin when available; otherwise derive a safe, stable local-workspace identity without revealing the absolute filesystem path. The default reports endpoint is `https://reports.quickstark.com/api/v1/readouts`; ordinary runs require no project list, owner pattern, producer identifier, harness setting, GitHub verification, Git remote, or private-IP viewer. Generate the immutable local report first and present the hosted `https://reports.quickstark.com/` report URL only after authenticated acceptance. Explicit local, LAN, or SSH viewers remain available. Never expose the private token, mislabel another project, accept unsafe project paths, or claim that a failed submission succeeded.
A completed report displays a compact Skill run metrics section near the top, immediately after Top next prompts. It shows actual skill-attributed model, reasoning effort, provider-reported input and output tokens, total tokens, and active duration only when the running harness or provider genuinely captured them. Show `Not captured` for unavailable values, preserve thread-level evidence under its actual scope, and never invent measurements or attach skill-run metrics to a catalog preview.

When this skill leaves a genuine user action, its readout may include `commands` containing the exact terminal command, a clear title, and a `detail` explaining why or when the user should run it. When actual source deserves attention, its readout may include `keyCode` containing the exact code, language, and optional safe repository-relative file path. Both appear as separate, copyable code blocks. Execution logs and already executed commands are not user instructions; omit both sections when they are not applicable. Never include secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, invented code, or speculative terminal instructions.

Depending on the actual completed work, tailor one to three top next prompts from:

**1. [`/qs-test-tdd`](https://github.com/quickstark/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/qs-test-tdd/SKILL.md)**

Add or complete behavior-focused coverage for the implemented change.

```text
Use $qs-test-tdd to implement this behavior using a red-green test-driven loop.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Test-driven work benefits from reasoning through behavior and regression seams.

**2. [`/qs-review-code`](https://github.com/quickstark/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/qs-review-code/SKILL.md)**

Review the implementation against its requirements and standards.

```text
Use $qs-review-code to review these changes for correctness, standards, and requirements.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Code review benefits from deeper correctness, security, and standards analysis.

**3. [`/qs-git-merge`](https://github.com/quickstark/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/qs-git-merge/SKILL.md)**

Integrate the reviewed change and verify its actual branch, pull request, and GitHub publication.

```text
Use $qs-git-merge to verify and complete the actual Git integration, pull request, or GitHub publication.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: GitHub integration benefits from verifying branch state, publication, pull requests, and competing changes.

## Where it fits

`qs-code-build` is the build step near the end of the main chain, just before the review:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → code-review
```

Reach for it after the work has been specced and sequenced, not before. Its key neighbours are [qs-plan-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which produces the tickets — each declaring its blocking edges — that it works through, and [qs-test-tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd), which it drives internally to write the tests at each seam before running its own [qs-review-code](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) pass and committing. When you're unsure which skill or flow fits, [qs-help](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes you.
