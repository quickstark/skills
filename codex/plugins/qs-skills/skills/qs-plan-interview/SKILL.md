description: Grill the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea. Use when the user wants to stress-test their thinking, or uses any 'grill' trigger phrases.

Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the decision tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time, waiting for feedback on each question before continuing. Asking multiple questions at once is bewildering.

If a *fact* can be found by exploring the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), look it up rather than asking me. The *decisions*, though, are mine — put each one to me and wait for my answer.

Do not act on it until I confirm we have reached a shared understanding.

## Completion report and next steps

Finish with a concise, readable completion report. Plain text or restrained Markdown is sufficient; do not create a separate report or HTML file unless this skill's primary workflow requires one.

```text
Status: Completed | Awaiting input | Blocked
Skills used: /qs-plan-interview; /another-skill only if actually used
Outcome: What was completed, discovered, decided, or is blocking progress.
Outputs: Real files, reports, decisions, or changes, when applicable.
Checks: Only the tests, validations, or observations actually performed.
Next best: /qs-skill-name — why it is the best next step.
```

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, and **Next best**. Omit **Outputs** or **Checks** when none exist. List only skills that actually ran; a recommendation belongs under **Next best**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a check, artifact, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant follow-ons from:

- `/qs-plan-clarify` — Turn interview answers into documented project decisions.
- `/qs-design-domain` — Resolve terminology or domain concepts exposed by the interview.
- `/qs-plan-spec` — Write a specification once the outstanding decisions are settled.

Explain why the recommendation advances the actual work. If the request is finished, say `Next best: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
