# QS Design: Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

This command is _informed_ by the project's domain model and built on a shared design vocabulary:

- Run the `/qs-design-modules` skill for the architecture vocabulary (**module**, **interface**, **depth**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**, **locality**) and its principles (the deletion test, "the interface is the test surface", "one adapter = hypothetical seam, two = real"). Use these terms exactly in every suggestion — don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."
- The domain language in `CONTEXT.md` gives names to good seams; ADRs in `docs/adr/` record decisions this command should not re-litigate.

## Process

### 1. Explore

**Scope before you scan — YAGNI.** Deepening a module pays off by making future changes to it easier, so put extra weight on the parts of the codebase that have recently changed. Decide *where* to look before you look:

- If the user named a direction — a module, a subsystem, a pain point — take it, and skip the inference below.
- Otherwise, walk back a good stretch of the commit history (`git log --oneline`) to find the codebase's hot spots — the files and areas that keep coming up — and let those paths pull your attention first. If the changes are scattered with no clear hot spot, widen the net.

Read the project's domain glossary (`CONTEXT.md`) and any ADRs in the area you're touching first.

Then use the Agent tool with `subagent_type=Explore` to walk the codebase. Don't follow rigid heuristics — explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow** — interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want.

### 2. Present candidates as an HTML report

Write a self-contained HTML file to the OS temp directory so nothing lands in the repo. Resolve the temp dir from `$TMPDIR`, falling back to `/tmp` (or `%TEMP%` on Windows), and write to `<tmpdir>/architecture-review-<timestamp>.html` so each run gets a fresh file. Include the real absolute path in the shared QuickStark skill readout. Open the primary report only when a local graphical browser is actually available: `xdg-open <path>` on desktop Linux, `open <path>` on macOS, or `start <path>` on Windows. On a headless or remote machine, present the readout through the private QuickStark viewer or an SSH tunnel; never claim a remote desktop opener displayed anything on the user's Mac.

The report uses **Tailwind via CDN** for layout and styling, and **Mermaid via CDN** for diagrams where a graph/flow/sequence reliably communicates the structure. Mix Mermaid with hand-crafted CSS/SVG visuals — use Mermaid when relationships are graph-shaped (call graphs, dependencies, sequences), and hand-built divs/SVG when you want something more editorial (mass diagrams, cross-sections, collapse animations). Each candidate gets a **before/after visualisation**. Be visual.

For each candidate, render a card with:

- **Files** — which files/modules are involved
- **Problem** — why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution** — plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits** — explained in terms of locality and leverage, and how tests would improve
- **Before / After diagram** — side-by-side, custom-drawn, illustrating the shallowness and the deepening
- **Recommendation strength** — one of `Strong`, `Worth exploring`, `Speculative`, rendered as a badge

End the report with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate you'd tackle first and why.

**Use CONTEXT.md vocabulary for the domain, and the `/qs-design-modules` vocabulary for the architecture.** If `CONTEXT.md` defines "Order," talk about "the Order intake module" — not "the FooBarHandler," and not "the Order service."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR. Mark it clearly in the card (e.g. a warning callout: _"contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…"_). Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids.

See [HTML-REPORT.md](HTML-REPORT.md) for the full HTML scaffold, diagram patterns, and styling guidance.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. After the file is written, ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Grilling loop

Once the user picks a candidate, run the `/qs-plan-interview` skill to walk the decision tree with them — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize — run the `/qs-design-domain` skill to keep the domain model current as you go:

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in `CONTEXT.md`?** Add the term to `CONTEXT.md`. Create the file lazily if it doesn't exist.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update `CONTEXT.md` right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR, framed as: _"Want me to record this as an ADR so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually be needed by a future explorer to avoid re-suggesting the same thing — skip ephemeral reasons ("not worth it right now") and self-evident ones.
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** Run the `/qs-design-modules` skill and use its design-it-twice parallel sub-agent pattern.

## Completion report and next steps

Finish every invocation with an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout and a concise in-chat completion report. Resolve the QuickStark root by walking upward from this skill's `SKILL.md`; both the canonical repository and installed Codex plugin contain `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs`.

Write a small JSON input containing the actual skill, status, outcome, findings, decisions, real outputs, checks actually performed, and relevant next skills. Generate the readout with:

```bash
node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" render --input "<absolute-path-to-readout.json>"
```

The render command automatically starts or reuses a verified readout viewer, selects an available port, and writes a uniquely named, self-contained HTML file. OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` storage remains the default. Set `QS_READOUT_DIR=/docker/appdata/quickstark-readouts` to opt into the durable, project-organized report library; verified Git identities automatically group immutable reports by project, year, and month. Its gallery provides a project library, searchable project explorer, and actual recent-activity timeline. On macOS or a graphical desktop the private viewer uses localhost. On a headless or SSH-connected Linux dev box it detects the private home-network IP, binds only to that address, protects the viewer with an unguessable URL, and returns a clickable report for a laptop on the same home network. Tailscale is not required. Set `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=ssh` to keep a remote viewer on localhost for explicit SSH forwarding, or `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=local` for local-only access.

Report the verified HTTP(S) readout URL and preserve the real HTML path. Preserve and link the skill's primary artifact when it produces one. Record a missing runtime, denied file access, unavailable home-network route, or failed viewer health check honestly; do not bind to every network interface, claim an unreachable URL, or pretend a readout exists.

```text
Status: Completed | Awaiting input | Blocked
Skills used: /qs-design-architecture; /another-skill only if actually used
Outcome: What was completed, discovered, decided, or is blocking progress.
Readout: Real absolute HTML path or verified private viewer URL.
Outputs: Real files, reports, decisions, or changes, when applicable.
Checks: Only the tests, validations, or observations actually performed.
Next best: /qs-skill-name — why it is the best next step.
```

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, **Readout**, and **Next best**. When the readout cannot be created, state `Readout: Not created —` and the actual reason. Omit **Outputs** or **Checks** when none exist. List only skills that actually ran; a recommendation belongs under **Next best**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a check, artifact, URL, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant follow-ons from:

- `/qs-design-modules` — Design the interface and seam for the selected architecture candidate.
- `/qs-plan-clarify` — Confirm the refactor's scope, constraints, and expected outcome.
- `/qs-plan-spec` — Document a selected, nontrivial refactoring before implementation.

Explain why the recommendation advances the actual work. If the request is finished, say `Next best: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
