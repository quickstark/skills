# QS Design: Domain

Actively build and sharpen the project's domain model as you design. This is the *active* discipline — challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is not this skill — that's a one-line habit any skill can do. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

## File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `CONTEXT.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).

## Completion report and next steps

Finish every invocation with an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout and a concise in-chat completion report. Resolve the QuickStark root by walking upward from this skill's `SKILL.md`; both the canonical repository and installed Codex plugin contain `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs`.

Write a small JSON input containing the actual skill, status, outcome, findings, decisions, real outputs, checks actually performed, and relevant next skills. Generate the readout with:

```bash
node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" render --input "<absolute-path-to-readout.json>"
```

The render command automatically starts or reuses a verified readout viewer, selects an available port, and writes a uniquely named, self-contained HTML file. Every promoted skill selects its own compact, purpose-specific report profile; accessible concept maps, evidence charts, review matrices, and check summaries visualize only actual recorded results. OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` storage remains the default. Set `QS_READOUT_DIR=/docker/appdata/quickstark-readouts` to opt into the durable, project-organized report library; verified Git identities automatically group immutable reports by project, year, and month. Its gallery provides a project library, searchable project explorer, and actual recent-activity timeline. On macOS or a graphical desktop the private viewer uses localhost. On a headless or SSH-connected Linux dev box it detects the private home-network IP, binds only to that address, protects the viewer with an unguessable URL, and returns a clickable report for a laptop on the same home network. Tailscale is not required. Set `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=ssh` to keep a remote viewer on localhost for explicit SSH forwarding, or `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=local` for local-only access.

Report the verified HTTP(S) readout URL and preserve the real HTML path. Preserve and link the skill's primary artifact when it produces one. Record a missing runtime, denied file access, unavailable home-network route, or failed viewer health check honestly; do not bind to every network interface, claim an unreachable URL, or pretend a readout exists.

```text
Status: Completed | Awaiting input | Blocked
Skills used: /qs-design-domain; /another-skill only if actually used
Outcome: What was completed, discovered, decided, or is blocking progress.
Readout: Real absolute HTML path or verified private viewer URL.
Outputs: Real files, reports, decisions, or changes, when applicable.
Checks: Only the tests, validations, or observations actually performed.
Next best: /qs-skill-name — why it is the best next step.
```

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, **Readout**, and **Next best**. When the readout cannot be created, state `Readout: Not created —` and the actual reason. Omit **Outputs** or **Checks** when none exist. List only skills that actually ran; a recommendation belongs under **Next best**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a check, artifact, URL, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant follow-ons from:

- `/qs-design-modules` — Design software boundaries using the clarified domain vocabulary.
- `/qs-plan-clarify` — Use the domain model to settle feature or refactoring requirements.
- `/qs-plan-spec` — Write the specification in the project's agreed domain language.

Explain why the recommendation advances the actual work. If the request is finished, say `Next best: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
