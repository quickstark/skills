description: Turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the project issue tracker — no interview, just synthesis of what you've already discussed.
---

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a spec (you may know this document as a PRD). Do NOT interview the user — just synthesize what you already know.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you — run `/qs-setup` if not.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the spec, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the spec using the template below, then publish it to the project issue tracker. Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label - no need for additional triage.

<spec-template>

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A LONG, numbered list of user stories. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

This list of user stories should be extremely extensive and cover all aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this spec.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.

## Completion report and next steps

Finish every invocation with an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout and a concise in-chat completion report. Resolve the QuickStark root by walking upward from this skill's `SKILL.md`; both the canonical repository and installed Codex plugin contain `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs`.

Write a small JSON input containing the actual skill, status, outcome, findings, decisions, real outputs, checks actually performed, and up to three relevant `nextSkills` objects containing `name`, `reason`, and a copy-ready `prompt`. Each prompt explicitly invokes its catalog-approved skill and carries forward the actual outcome, findings, decisions, outputs, and checks relevant to that follow-on. Present each full prompt in its own fenced text code block. Put its suggested model and thinking level in a visually muted callout underneath. Optionally supply `model`, `thinking`, and `modelReason` when the actual remaining work justifies a more specific heuristic suggestion. Record only directly verified execution context, delivery provenance, or relationships. Generate the readout with:

```bash
node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" render --input "<absolute-path-to-readout.json>"
```

The render command automatically starts or reuses a verified readout viewer, selects an available port, and writes a uniquely named, self-contained HTML file. Every promoted skill selects its own compact, purpose-specific report profile; accessible concept maps, evidence charts, review matrices, and check summaries visualize only actual recorded results. OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` storage remains the default. Set `QS_READOUT_DIR=/docker/appdata/quickstark-readouts` to opt into the durable, project-organized report library; verified Git identities automatically group immutable reports by project, year, and month. Its gallery provides a project library, searchable project explorer, and actual recent-activity timeline. On macOS or a graphical desktop the private viewer uses localhost. On a headless or SSH-connected Linux dev box it detects the private home-network IP, binds only to that address, protects the viewer with an unguessable URL, and returns a clickable report for a laptop on the same home network. Tailscale is not required. Set `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=ssh` to keep a remote viewer on localhost for explicit SSH forwarding, or `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=local` for local-only access.

The renderer automatically captures the actual execution machine and platform for every real skill run. Add `execution.deployments` only for directly observed environments, deployment states, and safe verified HTTP(S) URLs. Add `execution.files` only for repository-relative files this skill actually added, modified, deleted, or renamed, with a concise accurate change summary. Preserve unrelated existing work; never infer run-owned files from an already dirty worktree or expose secrets, `.env` files, credentials, absolute machine paths, or unverified deployment targets. Previews never claim an execution machine, deployment, or changed file.

When this run actually touches GitHub, a merge, or a release, add an optional `provenance` object containing only observed `pullRequests`, `closedIssues`, `release`, and `commit`. Verify GitHub numbers, record state, HTTPS links, repository ownership, release version, and complete Git hash. Set `commit.published` only after confirming remote publication; set `closedByRelease` only after independently confirming that exact release closed the issue. Omit missing evidence entirely. Record `relationships` only between observed findings, decisions, outputs, or checks; review findings may carry their actual `standards` or `specification` axis and `P0`–`P3` priority. Previews never contain delivery provenance or observed relationships.

Report the verified HTTP(S) readout URL and preserve the real HTML path. Preserve and link the skill's primary artifact when it produces one. Record a missing runtime, denied file access, unavailable home-network route, or failed viewer health check honestly; do not bind to every network interface, claim an unreachable URL, or pretend a readout exists.

```text
Status: Completed | Awaiting input | Blocked
Skills used: /qs-plan-spec; /another-skill only if actually used
Outcome: What was completed, discovered, decided, or is blocking progress.
Execution: Actual machine, with verified deployment and changed files when applicable.
Readout: Real absolute HTML path or verified private viewer URL.
Outputs: Real files, reports, decisions, or changes, when applicable.
Checks: Only the tests, validations, or observations actually performed.
Delivery: Verified PRs, closed issues, release, or commit, only when applicable.
```

**Top next prompts:**

**1. Recommended continuation**

Break a substantial specification into dependency-aware work.

```text
Use /qs-plan-tickets to break this plan into small, dependency-aware implementation tickets.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Ticket decomposition benefits from reasoning about scope and dependencies. Never change the active model or thinking level.

Use the same fenced-prompt and muted callout format for at most two genuinely relevant alternatives.

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, **Execution**, **Readout**, and **Top next prompts**. Make each complete, copy-ready prompt the visual focus in a fenced text code block. Place **Suggested model** and **Suggested thinking** underneath in a muted blockquote callout, label both as heuristic, and never change the active model or thinking level. These suggestions are not observed run measurements, comparative benchmarks, independently verified quality, or automatic model changes. When the readout cannot be created, state `Readout: Not created —` and the actual reason. Omit deployment details, changed files, **Outputs**, **Checks**, or **Delivery** when no corresponding evidence exists. List only skills that actually ran; suggested prompts belong under **Top next prompts**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a machine, check, changed file, artifact, issue, pull request, release, URL, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant, copy-ready prompt directions from:

**1. `/qs-plan-tickets`**

Break a substantial specification into dependency-aware work.

```text
Use /qs-plan-tickets to break this plan into small, dependency-aware implementation tickets.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Ticket decomposition benefits from reasoning about scope and dependencies.

**2. `/qs-code-build`**

Implement a small, sufficiently clear specification directly.

```text
Use /qs-code-build to implement this specification or ticket with appropriate tests.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Implementation benefits from sustained reasoning and direct verification.

**3. `/qs-design-modules`**

Resolve an important interface or module boundary before implementation.

```text
Use /qs-design-modules to design a clean, deep, and testable module for this problem.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-sol` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Module design benefits from carefully reasoning about interfaces and seams.

Tailor every selected prompt to this run's actual outcome and recorded evidence; the catalog wording is a starting point, not a substitute for the accomplished work. Explain why the prompt advances the actual remaining work. If the request is finished, say `Top next prompts: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
