description: A relentless interview to sharpen a plan or design.

Run a `/qs-plan-interview` session.

## Completion report and next steps

Finish every invocation with an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout and a concise in-chat completion report. Resolve the QuickStark root by walking upward from this skill's `SKILL.md`; both the canonical repository and installed Codex plugin contain `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs`.

Write a small JSON input containing the actual skill, status, outcome, findings, decisions, real outputs, checks actually performed, and relevant next skills. Generate the readout with:

```bash
node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" render --input "<absolute-path-to-readout.json>"
```

The render command automatically starts or reuses a verified readout viewer, selects an available port, and writes a uniquely named, self-contained HTML file. OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` storage remains the default. Set `QS_READOUT_DIR=/docker/appdata/quickstark-readouts` to opt into the durable, project-organized report library; verified Git identities automatically group immutable reports by project, year, and month. Its gallery provides a project library, searchable project explorer, and actual recent-activity timeline. On macOS or a graphical desktop the private viewer uses localhost. On a headless or SSH-connected Linux dev box it detects the private home-network IP, binds only to that address, protects the viewer with an unguessable URL, and returns a clickable report for a laptop on the same home network. Tailscale is not required. Set `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=ssh` to keep a remote viewer on localhost for explicit SSH forwarding, or `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=local` for local-only access.

Report the verified HTTP(S) readout URL and preserve the real HTML path. Preserve and link the skill's primary artifact when it produces one. Record a missing runtime, denied file access, unavailable home-network route, or failed viewer health check honestly; do not bind to every network interface, claim an unreachable URL, or pretend a readout exists.

```text
Status: Completed | Awaiting input | Blocked
Skills used: /qs-plan-explore; /another-skill only if actually used
Outcome: What was completed, discovered, decided, or is blocking progress.
Readout: Real absolute HTML path or verified private viewer URL.
Outputs: Real files, reports, decisions, or changes, when applicable.
Checks: Only the tests, validations, or observations actually performed.
Next best: /qs-skill-name — why it is the best next step.
```

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, **Readout**, and **Next best**. When the readout cannot be created, state `Readout: Not created —` and the actual reason. Omit **Outputs** or **Checks** when none exist. List only skills that actually ran; a recommendation belongs under **Next best**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a check, artifact, URL, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant follow-ons from:

- `/qs-plan-clarify` — Ground the explored idea in an actual codebase and durable decisions.
- `/qs-plan-research` — Investigate assumptions or unknowns exposed during exploration.
- `/qs-plan-spec` — Capture a sufficiently settled idea as a specification.

Explain why the recommendation advances the actual work. If the request is finished, say `Next best: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
