# QS Plan: Tickets

Break a plan, spec, or conversation into a set of **tickets** — tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you — run `/qs-setup` if not.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a reference (a spec path, an issue number or URL) as an argument, fetch it and read its full body and comments.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Ticket titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets.

<vertical-slice-rules>

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests) — vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

</vertical-slice-rules>

Give each ticket its **blocking edges** — the other tickets that must complete before it can start. A ticket with no blockers can start immediately.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change — rename a column, retype a shared symbol — whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so a single edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. Don't force it into a tracer bullet; sequence it as **expand–contract**. First expand: add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks. Then migrate the call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), each batch its own ticket blocked by the expand, keeping CI green batch to batch because the old form still exists. Finally contract: delete the old form once no caller remains, in a ticket blocked by every migrate batch. When even the batches can't stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket — green is promised only there.

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Blocked by**: which other tickets (if any) must complete first
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the blocking edges correct — does each ticket only depend on tickets that genuinely gate it?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish the tickets to the configured tracker

Publish the approved tickets. **How** depends on the tracker `/qs-setup` configured — the tickets are the same either way, only the shape of the blocking edges changes:

- **Local files** → write one file per ticket under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` in dependency order (blockers first). Each file's "Blocked by" lists the numbers/titles it depends on. Use the per-ticket file template below — one ticket per file, never a single combined file.
- **A real issue tracker (GitHub, Linear, …)** → publish one issue per ticket in dependency order (blockers first) so each ticket's blocking edges can reference real identifiers. Use the platform's native blocking / sub-issue relationship where it has one; otherwise set each ticket's "Blocked by" to the blocking issues. Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label unless instructed otherwise — the tickets are agent-grabbable by construction.

Work the **frontier**: any ticket whose blockers are all done. For a purely linear chain that means top to bottom.

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue.

<local-ticket-template>

# <NN> — <Ticket title>

**What to build:** the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective — not a layer-by-layer implementation list.

**Blocked by:** the numbers/titles of the tickets that gate this one, or "None — can start immediately".

**Status:** ready-for-agent

- [ ] Acceptance criterion 1
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 2

</local-ticket-template>

<issue-template>

## Parent

A reference to the parent issue on the tracker (if the source was an existing issue, otherwise omit this section).

## What to build

The end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective — not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Blocked by

- A reference to each blocking ticket, or "None — can start immediately".

</issue-template>

In either form, avoid specific file paths or code snippets — they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Completion report and next steps

Finish every invocation with an architecture-quality, self-contained HTML readout and a concise in-chat completion report. Resolve the QuickStark root by walking upward from this skill's `SKILL.md`; both the canonical repository and installed Codex plugin contain `scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs`.

Write a small JSON input containing the actual skill, status, outcome, findings, decisions, real outputs, checks actually performed, and up to three relevant `nextSkills` objects containing `name`, `reason`, and a copy-ready `prompt`. Each prompt explicitly invokes its catalog-approved skill and carries forward the actual outcome, findings, decisions, outputs, and checks relevant to that follow-on. Use the Codex-native `$qs-...` skill spelling for automatically generated follow-on prompts; existing explicit `/qs-...` prompts remain supported. A resolved blue skill mention is controlled by the Codex composer and its skill picker, not by HTML, Markdown, clipboard text, or the readout viewer. Present each full prompt in its own fenced text code block. Put its suggested model and thinking level in a visually muted callout underneath. Optionally supply `model`, `thinking`, and `modelReason` when the actual remaining work justifies a more specific heuristic suggestion. Record only directly verified execution context, delivery provenance, or relationships. Generate the readout with:

```bash
node "<QuickStark root>/scripts/qs-skill-readout.mjs" render --input "<absolute-path-to-readout.json>"
```

The render command automatically starts or reuses a verified readout viewer, selects an available port, and writes a uniquely named, self-contained HTML file. Every promoted skill selects its own compact, purpose-specific report profile; accessible concept maps, evidence charts, review matrices, and check summaries visualize only actual recorded results. OS temporary `quickstark-readouts` storage remains the default. Set `QS_READOUT_DIR=/docker/appdata/quickstark-readouts` to opt into the durable, project-organized report library; verified Git identities automatically group immutable reports by project, year, and month. Its full-height, project-first Project Workbench integrates verified project navigation, searchable actual skill runs, and complete immutable readouts in one responsive page. On macOS or a graphical desktop the private viewer uses localhost. On a headless or SSH-connected Linux dev box it detects the private home-network IP, binds only to that address, protects the viewer with an unguessable URL, and returns a clickable report for a laptop on the same home network. Tailscale is not required. Set `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=ssh` to keep a remote viewer on localhost for explicit SSH forwarding, or `QS_READOUT_ACCESS=local` for local-only access.

The renderer automatically captures the actual execution machine and platform for every real skill run. Add `execution.deployments` only for directly observed environments, deployment states, and safe verified HTTP(S) URLs. Add `execution.files` only for repository-relative files this skill actually added, modified, deleted, or renamed, with a concise accurate change summary. Preserve unrelated existing work; never infer run-owned files from an already dirty worktree or expose secrets, `.env` files, credentials, absolute machine paths, or unverified deployment targets. Previews never claim an execution machine, deployment, or changed file.

When this run actually touches GitHub, a merge, or a release, add an optional `provenance` object containing only observed `pullRequests`, `closedIssues`, `release`, and `commit`. Verify GitHub numbers, record state, HTTPS links, repository ownership, release version, and complete Git hash. Set `commit.published` only after confirming remote publication; set `closedByRelease` only after independently confirming that exact release closed the issue. Omit missing evidence entirely. Record `relationships` only between observed findings, decisions, outputs, or checks; review findings may carry their actual `standards` or `specification` axis and `P0`–`P3` priority. Previews never contain delivery provenance or observed relationships.

Report the verified HTTP(S) readout URL and preserve the real HTML path. Preserve and link the skill's primary artifact when it produces one. Record a missing runtime, denied file access, unavailable home-network route, or failed viewer health check honestly; do not bind to every network interface, claim an unreachable URL, or pretend a readout exists.

```text
Status: Completed | Awaiting input | Blocked
Skills used: /qs-plan-tickets; /another-skill only if actually used
Outcome: What was completed, discovered, decided, or is blocking progress.
Execution: Actual machine, with verified deployment and changed files when applicable.
Readout: Real absolute HTML path or verified private viewer URL.
Outputs: Real files, reports, decisions, or changes, when applicable.
Checks: Only the tests, validations, or observations actually performed.
Delivery: Verified PRs, closed issues, release, or commit, only when applicable.
```

**Top next prompts:**

**1. Recommended continuation**

Implement the next unblocked ticket.

```text
Use $qs-code-build to implement this specification or ticket with appropriate tests.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Implementation benefits from sustained reasoning and direct verification. Never change the active model or thinking level.

Use the same fenced-prompt and muted callout format for at most two genuinely relevant alternatives.

Always include **Status**, **Skills used**, **Outcome**, **Execution**, **Readout**, and **Top next prompts**. Make each complete, copy-ready prompt the visual focus in a fenced text code block. Place **Suggested model** and **Suggested thinking** underneath in a muted blockquote callout, label both as heuristic, and never change the active model or thinking level. These suggestions are not observed run measurements, comparative benchmarks, independently verified quality, or automatic model changes. When the readout cannot be created, state `Readout: Not created —` and the actual reason. Omit deployment details, changed files, **Outputs**, **Checks**, or **Delivery** when no corresponding evidence exists. List only skills that actually ran; suggested prompts belong under **Top next prompts**, not **Skills used**. Never claim a machine, check, changed file, artifact, issue, pull request, release, URL, or result you did not verify.

Select at most three genuinely relevant, copy-ready prompt directions from:

**1. `/qs-code-build`**

Implement the next unblocked ticket.

```text
Use $qs-code-build to implement this specification or ticket with appropriate tests.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Implementation benefits from sustained reasoning and direct verification.

**2. `/qs-test-tdd`**

Establish the agreed test seam for a ticket before implementation.

```text
Use $qs-test-tdd to implement this behavior using a red-green test-driven loop.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `high`
>
> Heuristic: Test-driven work benefits from reasoning through behavior and regression seams.

**3. `/qs-flow-handoff`**

Transfer the next ticket and its context into a fresh session.

```text
Use $qs-flow-handoff to prepare a concise handoff so another session can continue this work.
```

> Suggested model: `gpt-5.6-terra` · Suggested thinking: `medium`
>
> Heuristic: A handoff benefits from concise preservation of verified state and decisions.

Tailor every selected prompt to this run's actual outcome and recorded evidence; the catalog wording is a starting point, not a substitute for the accomplished work. Explain why the prompt advances the actual remaining work. If the request is finished, say `Top next prompts: None — the requested work is complete.` If input or approval is required, name the decision and do not imply that a suggested skill has already run.
